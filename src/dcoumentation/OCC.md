# Project Overview

## Project Name
### Octopus DB: Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) for Worker Pool

## 1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed technical design for the implementation of an Optimistic Concurrency Control (OCC) system within the WorkerPool architecture. This system will ensure data consistency and version management across concurrent worker threads.

### 1.2 Scope
This document covers the design of the OCCHandler, the integration with WorkerPool, and the data model (VersionedData). It outlines the architecture, components, data flow, and key operations.

## 2. Objectives
Implement an OCC mechanism to manage concurrent access and modification of shared data in a multi-threaded environment.

Ensure data consistency across worker threads in the WorkerPool.

Minimize conflict and ensure seamless operation handling.

## 3. System Overview
3.1 High-Level Architecture
The system is composed of multiple worker threads managed by a WorkerPool. Each worker operates on a shared set of data, with version control enforced by the OCCHandler. The OCCHandler validates the data version before any operation to prevent conflicts.

## 4. Detailed Design
### 4.1 Architecture
Preview unavailable
WorkerPool: Manages the worker threads and handles task distribution.

OCCHandler: Ensures optimistic concurrency control by validating data versions.

VersionedData: Represents the data model with a version attribute for version control.

### 4.2 Components
### 4.2.1 WorkerPool
Responsibilities: Manage worker threads, assign tasks, and handle thread lifecycle.

Key Methods:

addWorker(): Adds a worker to the pool.

runWorker(): Assigns tasks to available workers.

getWorkerMetadata(): Retrieves metadata for a specific worker.

4.2.2 OCCHandler
Responsibilities: Ensure that operations are performed on the correct version of data, prevent conflicts, and increment data versions post-operation.

Key Methods:

validateVersion(): Validates the version of the data before operation.

performOperation(): Executes an operation if the version is valid.

incrementVersion(): Increments the data version after a successful operation.

### 4.2.3 VersionedData
Responsibilities: Model for storing data with versioning information.

Attributes:

id: Unique identifier for the data.

version: Integer representing the current version of the data.

## 4.3 Data Flow
Task Assignment: The WorkerPool assigns tasks to workers.

Version Validation: Before a worker performs an operation, OCCHandler validates the data version.

Operation Execution: If validation passes, the operation is performed.

Version Increment: After a successful operation, the version is incremented to reflect the change.

## 4.4 Key Algorithms and Operations
### 4.4.1 Version Validation
Input: id, expectedVersion

Output: boolean (true if versions match)

Description: The algorithm checks if the current version of the data matches the expected version before proceeding with the operation.

### 4.4.2 Operation Execution
Input: workerId, expectedVersion, operation

Output: void (throws error if version mismatch or operation fails)

Description: This operation is performed on the data if the version is validated, ensuring that no conflicting updates occur.

## 5. Technical Considerations
### 5.1 Concurrency Control
The system uses optimistic concurrency control, which assumes that conflicts are rare and checks for conflicts only at the time of committing changes.

### 5.2 Error Handling
The system logs errors related to version mismatches and operation failures. These errors are critical for maintaining data consistency.

### 5.3 Performance
The system is designed to handle high concurrency with minimal overhead, ensuring that workers can operate efficiently.

## 6. Trade-offs and Decisions
### 6.1 OCC vs. Pessimistic Concurrency Control
Decision: Chose OCC due to its lower overhead and better performance in high-concurrency environments.

Trade-off: OCC might require retrying operations in case of conflicts, potentially leading to higher latency in conflict scenarios.

### 6.2 Data Store
Decision: Use an in-memory Map for storing worker data in this implementation.

Trade-off: Limited scalability and persistence compared to a distributed data store.

## 7. Future Enhancements
### 7.1 Distributed WorkerPool
Extend the WorkerPool to support distributed environments, allowing workers to operate across multiple nodes.

### 7.2 Enhanced Conflict Resolution
Implement conflict resolution strategies such as automatic retries or merging data changes.

### 7.3 Persistent Data Store
Integrate a persistent data store (e.g., Redis, Cassandra) for better scalability and durability.

## 8. Appendix
### 8.1 Glossary
OCC (Optimistic Concurrency Control): A concurrency control method that checks for conflicts only at the time of committing a transaction.

WorkerPool: A design pattern where a pool of worker threads performs tasks assigned to them.
