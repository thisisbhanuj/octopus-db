// ************************************************************************************************* //
// Key Points
// Reentrancy: The mutex allows a thread to acquire the lock multiple times. Each call to lock increments a count for that thread.
// Release Mechanism: unlock only releases the lock when the thread has released it as many times as it acquired it. It throws an error if the lock is being released by a thread that doesnâ€™t own it.
// Fairness and Queueing: The mutex uses a queue to handle waiting threads, ensuring that threads acquire the lock in the order they requested it.
// Thread Identification: Implement getCurrentThreadId to return a unique identifier for the current thread or process. This implementation assumes a placeholder method for thread identification.

/**
* ### Octopus Reentrant Mutex
* To implement reentrant locking in a multi-threaded environment,
* you'll need to ensure that the same thread or process can acquire 
* the lock multiple times without causing a deadlock or other issues.
* 
* ### Key Concepts for Reentrant Locking
* - Reentrant Mutex: Allows a thread to acquire the same lock multiple times. This is typically done by tracking the number of times the lock has been acquired by the same thread.
* - Thread Tracking: Maintain a record of the thread or process that currently holds the lock and how many times it has acquired the lock.
* - Release on Last Unlock: The lock is only fully released when the thread that originally acquired it has released it as many times as it acquired it.
